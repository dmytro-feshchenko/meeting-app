# Meeting App
Powerful online meeting solution written in Java.

Note: This application is under active development.

## Motivation
The idea for the application was born in 2017 year to create
powerful (but yet simple) solution for developers (both
companies and freelancers) designed for real-time communication
and collaboration.
For this purposes I'm going to use Spring MVC (Java) together
with React (JavaScript) to design high quality solution.

## Build and run:
Open your terminal and type:
```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Than you can navigate to the page <a href="http://localhost:8080/api">http://localhost:8080/api</a> to see all
available methods and links.

### What do we use:
- Spring Boot + Spring REST
- Hibernate + PostgreSQL
- <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack 2</a> - for building frontend part of the application
